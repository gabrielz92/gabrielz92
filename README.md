<h1>Hello world, Gabriel Zenobi here</h1>
I am a Physics student with 1 year and a half of career and 1 year of studies in Data Science, in 2022 I started the degree of Computer Scientist, lover of mathematics, modeling of dynamic systems and simulation.
During 2021 I worked in +15 independent projects related to financial markets, researching and developing techniques for the creation of trading systems using Machine Learning and Deep Learning with Python in addition to the Ninjatrader and Metatrader platforms, along with the management of risk metrics using a simulator that I programmed in Cython.<br/><br/>
Another of my important works in this area was the creation of a toolkit for investment funds, banks and traders... this is the Order flow, Volume profile, Bookmap, Volume Filter, among others(the Wyckoff method).
Even in my search I consider myself a student in this subject and I am looking to work with people who are interested in the use of these technologies applied to the markets (hedge funds, traders, investment banks, etc..).

<h2>History + Experience.</h2>
### 2011 - My beginnings as a Black-Hat
Back in 2011 when I started with programming(as an autodidact) I was interested in the mathematical concepts of computing, so I start reading a lot and practicing with assemblerx86, then C and C++. At that time I learned reverse engineering thanks to the articles/pdfs of the master Ricardo Narvaja and Corelancoder in the development of the beginning of Exploits, Rootkits, sniffers and my first trojans in Pascal(Delphi 7) which introduced me to understand how sockets and TCP/IP protocol worked, at that time there were challenges in cracklatinos and other pages in which I participated anonymously, also i dominated Backtrack 5 distro and with that others hacking techniques. I was also introduced to the world of web development.

### 2012 - First jobs.
Although with my first year of studies I managed to understand many concepts related to memory, the Heap, Stack, PE-Headers, programming languages and reverse engineering my path had just begun. I decided to take my first freelance jobs(in web developing), and so I did my first projects receiving my payments, I was still a novice but I was advancing towards the industry with a lot of works...

### 2013 - Linux driver programming and publications.
During 2013 I was making my first publications of all the knowledge I had extracted, one of my most beloved was indetectables.net(my alias was NvK) and my pass by foro.elhacker.net(alias Warz0n3) where I competed in a programming tournament, I made my first mini-video game in 15 days using python and although it was completely made from 0, it had optimization problems(due to lack of time) even so I won second place!.
In this same year I started to understand how Ring 0 programming worked and i develop some analysis techniques based on this. Linux and Backtrack were great teachers for me, and it didn't take me long to create hooks, keyloggers, debugging techniques in Ring 0, etc..., but also tools that helped to detect malwares (all working at system level and elevating privileges). On the other hand, I have never stopped working as a freelancer.

### 2014 - Reverse engineering, my last stage.
After 2013 I ended up spending 1 more year studying reverse engineering at a much more advanced level(in the development of dynamic and static analysis of malware) this would be my last year in this area as a freelance researcher, and it was rewarding because I managed to understand how the code worked at low level(ASM, C/C++) understanding its architecture from machine code and memory management, doing more experiments with the Heap and Stack for the development of Exploits and Shellcodes(mainly from Backtrack but later on Windows). There I finished mastering IDA(developing some plugins), OllyDBG and WinDbg for the study of the drivers in Windows and with this I achieved to stop processes with memory protection to exploit them... Even so I never stopped working in programming as a freelancer having many projects more than in the previous year working long hours.

### 2015 - Web developing
I left the world of reverse engineering and exploits definitely because I got tired of it and felt I had to take a new direction, so I continued working on multi-projects; HTML, CSS, PHP and more later a little bit of JQuery. I can't say that front-end and back-end development is my favorite thing, but it was necessary and exciting to spend(in total time) about +4 years and a half using these technologies while I followed in parallel other studies and projects in C++. In mid 2015 I studied for myself to the study of mathematics in a self-taught way (basic calculus, a little bit of physics, among other branches) while i continued my work.

### 2016 - Simulation + OpenGL
With the new knowledge I gained in mathematics I still felt that I was missing something fundamental: simulators. At that time I started with the OpenGL library and focused on understanding how it works by doing basic simulations in 2d (and a little in 3d) of basic Newtonian physics equations and graphics engines.I continued doing experiments that led me to the development of the beginning of my first engine "OmegaDream"(programmed in C++), which would be a simple graphics engine to develop 2d games (using shadders and other techniques that I learned), in addition to embed AngelScript in it presented other particularities, however this would be all... because by the end of 2016 by an accident with my main pc I lost all the advances that I had presented (I was 1 year without making copies of any kind) and I started all over again using the SDL library and Qt, but I ended up leaving the project for lack of time.

### 2017 - Mathematics, development and jobs
Thanks to what happened in 2016 I found my passion only in physics and mathematics, however my desire was to merge all this with computers. I spent that year studying some concepts that I only put into practice by means of simple and not very extensive algorithms(but complex in formulas y very useful), besides deepening in more theoretical concepts of programming. Although I must admit that my main idea was always to apply it to simulation and not to software development itself. This new knowledge allowed me to do more ambitious work as a freelancer.

### 2018 and 2019 - University, Physics and Trading
I started 2018 doing a degree in physics at the Universidad Nacional del Sur(UNS), at that time I was working and studying so it was not easy to keep the career. Due to personal issues I had to leave the university in mid 2019 but with all I had learned I managed to work in an investment fund that just started (and now extinct) Ferini Capital. I learned everything related to financial markets and how a trader operates, as well as how Dark Pools, Futures(Ninjatrader8), Forex(Metatrader5) and Market makers work. I finished with the pandemic but my studies did not end there ....

During that time I started to develop Order Flow, which I did from scratch.By that time I already understood the contract and volume mechanisms offered by Futures and all these financial instruments, so after many tests and headaches I managed to capture this information to do Type-Reading, Volume Profile, Book Mapping, etc... understanding the Wyckoff method was useful in an initial stage but I was falling short, due to the advance and frenzy of modern markets (by the increase of the underlying volatility and amount of robots).

### 2020 and 2021 - A new world in the financial markets.
After I left the investment fund I decided to continue as an independent researcher in financial markets, at that time I learn Machine Learning and some mathematical models in this area; AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA processes, Moving Averages, Holt model, study of indicators using ML, Markov chains, multivariate analysis, among others... I understood how some of these models are useless against the markets if they are used without consideration, and the importance of stochastic processes and stationarity. Thus, developing a trading simulator in Python + Cython (by console), in addition to the use of Monte-Carlo methods and genetic algorithms for the optimization of metrics (accuracy, Sharpe ratio, Drawdown, among many, many more... .).
I ended up studying ensemble learning models and rules extraction using decision trees to make expert trading systems and I understood many market concepts that I still did not know, finally I studied Deep learning and Reinforcement learning with the aim of bringing all this to trading.
I managed to go back to university in 2022 to study Computer Science, with more ambitious future goals in trading, data science and directing software projects!!.
